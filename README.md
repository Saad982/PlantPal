My Scenario
PlantPal lets users take pictures of their plants using the camera and save them with the plant’s name. When you add a plant, the app also grabs your current location. You can see all your added plants in My Plants, and tapping a plant shows its location on a small map.

Besides this, the app includes several other useful screens:

  A Water Schedule page that shows static watering data for plants.
  A Care Tips section to help users learn how to take better care of their plants.
  A Library page where users can search for different plants and get more information about them.
  An About page that explains the purpose and features of the application.


What Plugins Are Used and How Are They Relevant?
  Camera: To take pictures of plants in the Add Plant feature.
  Geolocation: To get the user’s location when adding a plant.
  Leaflet JS: To display the location on a map in the My Plants section.
